# Welcome to the NSK Introduction.

This is the fourth iteration of Nexxus Stock Keeping, built from the ground up using entirely different code. Welcome to the future of inventory management.

Nexxus automatically generates order statuses when specific functionalities within the system are utilized. These are:

"To plan and pickup" when using public pickup order form
"Products to assign" when using the public sales order form
"Backorder" when a purchase order is automatically created with a coupled sales internally or externally (webshop)
"To repair" for sales order which are repair

The software evolved and it became possible to also keep track of other objects besides computers. Also a billing part was introduced so we could use it as a point of sales and automated inserts into a webshop.
