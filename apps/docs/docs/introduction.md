# Welcome to the NSK Introduction.

In 2023 we decided to start developing from the ground up with an international team based on an entirely different code. This repository tracks the development of the fourth version of Nexxus Stock Keeping.

Nsk has a order statuses that will be automatically created when certain functionalities of Nexxus are used. These are:

"To plan and pickup" when using public pickup order form
"Products to assign" when using the public sales order form
"Backorder" when a purchase order is automatically created with a coupled sales internally or externally (webshop)
"To repair" for sales order which are repair

The software evolved and it became possible to also keep track of other objects besides computers. Also a billing part was introduced so we could use it as a point of sales and automated inserts into a webshop.

Since we picked up objects through the country, we needed a way to keep track of logistics and distribution. Most of the whishes have been implemented, however the more data the slower the application.
